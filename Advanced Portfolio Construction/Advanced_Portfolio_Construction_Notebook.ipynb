    "This notebook explores advanced techniques in portfolio construction, such as mean-variance optimization, risk parity, and the Black-Litterman model. We will demonstrate both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations using Python. The goal is to equip you with a robust understanding of these methods, enabling you to apply them in real-world scenarios.\n",
