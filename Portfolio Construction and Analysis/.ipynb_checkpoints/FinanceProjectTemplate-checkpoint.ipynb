    "In this first section, I dive into the fundamental risk and performance indicators critical to portfolio management. I start by demystifying volatility as the primary measure of risk. Then, I delve into the significance and persistence of risks in non-normal return distributions, highlighting the importance of understanding higher-order moments for strategic asset allocation.\n",

    "I also introduce more nuanced risk metrics like Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), crucial for handling assets with non-standard returns. This part is about laying the essential groundwork for navigating portfolio risks and enhancing performance with a keen eye on the intricacies of asset behavior."
